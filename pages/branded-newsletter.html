			<span>Hi, Zoe</span>
			<p>
				Putting available talent to its best use is key for the welfare of individuals and of the society to
				which they belong. Unequal access to opportunity in education and labour markets tampers with the
				allocation of talent leading to more inequality.
			</p>

			<p>
				This newsletter focuses on the misallocation of talent by economic class and gender in different
				settings, highlighting how temporary shocks
			</p>

			<p>
				Such as the current pandemic can have permanent consequences.

				<h2>Creating a UX Research Report doesnâ€™t have to be hard...</h2>
				<p>Writing up a UX research report is just as important as conducting the research itself. Iâ€™ve created
					a template to help you create your research report, so you can actually focus on synthesising the
					findings, rather than worrying about creating a brand-new deck.</p>
